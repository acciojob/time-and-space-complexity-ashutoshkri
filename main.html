<h1>Understanding Time Space Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity defines how the runtime of an algorithm increases with input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity.</p>

<p><b>Space Complexity</b> tells how much memory an algorithm uses. For example, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size.</p>
